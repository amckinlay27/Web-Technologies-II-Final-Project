                    <h1>Year End Announcement</h1>
                    <p>“As the year comes to a close, we like to take the time each year to thank each and every one of our clients and consumers. We are grateful for
                       your business and trust. Without you none of this would be possible. To show our appreciation, each and every year we announce our annual Christmas
                       charitable drive. This year, 50% of all sale from December 1 to December 31st will be donated to Habitat for Humanity. We hope you all have a Merry
                       Christmas and a Happy New Year.” ~ Max Power</p>

                    <h1>Who we Are</h1>
                    <p>Our team is lead by our CEO Kenneth Chambers, a husband, father, grandfather, and avid golfer. Ken brings more than 30 years of sales and management
                       experience, and nearly just as many in quality management. Ken and our management team participate annually in the Electric Can Openers Association’s Gala,
                       where we have received for the past five consecutive years, the E-cany Award, highlighting our tremendous success and commitment to the products of the
                       industry. </p>
                    <aside>“Without the team I am graced with each and every day, this award would not be possible.” ~ Max Power</aside>
