                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/86/71/69/867169738b204cd560977f16dadd8dde--old-photos-vintage-photos.jpg" alt="Alexander McKinlay">
                <p>Our story is unlike most, dating back to the 1860’s. It was a few years after the first can opener was created in the United States. When word spread to the 
                   great white north, Alexander McKinlay could not help but take notice. A craftsman and mathematician whose passion for intelligent design would lead him to a career
                   in can openers. His eye for intricate detail and their mechanics helped lead him to the most efficiently designed can openers. He would acquire the can openers
                   early, running extensive test to prove their worth. Once proved he would walk around his home tome, selling door to door.</p>
                <p>Alexander McKinlay’s eye for detail has carried over for over the past century. Testing the designs to their limitations, using advance technology to determine
                   quality, and only selling the best to our customers. A lot has changed over the past century, but our guarantee remains intact, Quality, Dedication, Family.
                   Values that we have carried with us for the past 100 years, values we will carry for the next 100.</p>
